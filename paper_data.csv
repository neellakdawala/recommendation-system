0,"Theory, methodology, and implementation of robotic intelligence and communication","This paper makes several uncommon claims. First, it suggests a theoretical approach, even though the theory comes with a clear methodology and implementation, so that we know what we do, how we do it, and why it is best to do it that way. Second, it pushes forward HARMS communication in natural language and explains why it is better that way. Third, it insists on the semantic approach so that all the HARMS agents ""understand"" (or even understand) what is going on--along with what is not. Fourth, most specifically and, hence, perhaps least importantly, it proposes one particular method of doing it, mildly hinting that some of its principles are unavoidable",Victor Raskin,5
1,An Efficient Multi-Objective Meta-heuristic Method for Probabilistic Transmission Network Planning,"In this paper, a new method is proposed for probabilistic transmission network expansion planning in Smart Grid. The proposed method makes use of Controlled Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (CNSGA-II) of multi-objective meta-heuristics (MOMH) to calculate a set of the Pareto solutions. In recent years, electric power networks increase the degree of uncertainties due to new environment of Smart Grid with renewable energy, distributed generation, Demand Response (DR), etc. Smart grid planners are interested in improving power supply reliability of transmission networks so that probabilistic expansion planning approaches are required. This paper focuses on a multi-objective problem in probabilistic transmission network expansion planning. The multi-objective optimization problem may be expressed as multi-metaheuristic formulation that evaluates a set of the Pareto solutions in Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). In this paper, CNSGA-II is used to calculate a set of the Pareto Solutions. The proposed method is successfully applied to the IEEE 24-bus reliability test system.","Kakuta Hiroki,Hiroyuki Mori",3

3,Clustering Of Web User Sessions To Maintain Occurrence Of Sequence In Navigation Pattern,"Web log data available at server side helps in identifying the most appropriate pages based on the user request. Analysis of web log data poses challenges as it consists of abundant information of a web page. In this paper a novel technique has been proposed to pre-process the web log data to extract sequence of occurrence and navigation patterns helpful for prediction. Each URL in the web log data is parsed into tokens based on the web structure. Tokens are uniquely identified for the classification of URLs. The sequence of URLs navigated by a user for a period of 30 minutes is treated as a session. Session represents the navigation pattern of a user. Sessions from multiple users are clustered using hierarchical agglomerative clustering technique to analyze the occurrence of sequence in the navigation patterns. From each cluster, a session is identified as a representative as it holds most possible pages in the sequence, other sessions in the cluster are the subset of the representative session. Session representative navigation patterns are useful for predicting the most appropriate pages for the user request. The proposed model is tested on web log files of NASA and enggresources.","Anupama D.S.,Sahana D. Gowda",17
4,Agent-based Framework for Sensor-to-Sensor Personalization,"In Wireless Sensor Networks, personalization has been seen by researchers as the process of tailoring services to fulfill requests of different users with different profiles. This vision ignores that individual sensors commonly have different profiles and contexts and therefore different needs. In this paper, we aim at extending personalization by allowing sensors to support each other with services that mutually fit their differences. To this end, we propose an agent-based framework where sensor nodes delegate software agents (static or mobile) to collect valuable data about the neighboring sensors and the spatial characteristics of their surrounding environments. We also show how this framework may be used to make the routing and relocation processes more personalized.","Nabil Sahlia,Nafaa Jabeurb,Mohamad Badrac",17
5,"Towards a Holistic Approach for Problems in the
Energy and Mobility Domain","With the current rise of electric vehicles, it is possible to use those vehicles for storing surplus energy from renewable energy sources; however, this can be in conflict with providing and ensuring the mobility of the vehicle’s user. At DAI-Labor, we have a large number of both, past and upcoming projects concerned with those two aspects of managing electric vehicles: energy and mobility. To unify and facilitate developments in those projects, we developed common domain models describing the different aspects of the e-mobility domain. Those domain models are used in many of our projects for optimising charging schedules and for ensuring the user’s mobility",Marco Lutzenberger,12
6,IoT Security Techniques Based on Machine Learning: How Do IoT Devices Use AI to Enhance Security?,"The Internet of things (IoT), which integrates a variety of devices into networks to provide advanced and intelligent services, has to protect user privacy and address attacks such as spoofing attacks, denial of service (DoS) attacks, jamming, and eavesdropping. We investigate the attack model for IoT systems and review the IoT security solutions based on machine-learning (ML) techniques including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning (RL). ML-based IoT authentication, access control, secure offloading, and malware detection schemes to protect data privacy are the focus of this article. We also discuss the challenges that need to be addressed to implement these ML-based security schemes in practical IoT systems.","Liang Xiao,Xiaoyue Wan,Xiaozhen Lu,Yanyong Zhang,Di Wu",390
7,"BioSeq-Analysis: a platform for DNA, RNA and protein sequence analysis based on machine learning approaches","With the avalanche of biological sequences generated in the post-genomic age, one of the most challenging problems is how to computationally analyze their structures and functions. Machine learning techniques are playing key roles in this field. Typically, predictors based on machine learning techniques contain three main steps: feature extraction, predictor construction and performance evaluation. Although several Web servers and stand-alone tools have been developed to facilitate the biological sequence analysis, they only focus on individual step. In this regard, in this study a powerful Web server called BioSeq-Analysis (http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/BioSeq-Analysis/) has been proposed to automatically complete the three main steps for constructing a predictor. The user only needs to upload the benchmark data set. BioSeq-Analysis can generate the optimized predictor based on the benchmark data set, and the performance measures can be reported as well. Furthermore, to maximize user’s convenience, its stand-alone program was also released, which can be downloaded from http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/BioSeq-Analysis/download/, and can be directly run on Windows, Linux and UNIX. Applied to three sequence analysis tasks, experimental results showed that the predictors generated by BioSeq-Analysis even outperformed some state-of-the-art methods. It is anticipated that BioSeq-Analysis will become a useful tool for biological sequence analysis.",Bin Liu,221
8,Pareto-Based Multiobjective Machine Learning: An Overview and Case Studies,"Machine learning is inherently a multiobjective task. Traditionally, however, either only one of the objectives is adopted as the cost function or multiple objectives are aggregated to a scalar cost function. This can be mainly attributed to the fact that most conventional learning algorithms can only deal with a scalar cost function. Over the last decade, efforts on solving machine learning problems using the Pareto-based multiobjective optimization methodology have gained increasing impetus, particularly due to the great success of multiobjective optimization using evolutionary algorithms and other population-based stochastic search methods. It has been shown that Pareto-based multiobjective learning approaches are more powerful compared to learning algorithms with a scalar cost function in addressing various topics of machine learning, such as clustering, feature selection, improvement of generalization ability, knowledge extraction, and ensemble generation. One common benefit of the different multiobjective learning approaches is that a deeper insight into the learning problem can be gained by analyzing the Pareto front composed of multiple Pareto-optimal solutions. This paper provides an overview of the existing research on multiobjective machine learning, focusing on supervised learning. In addition, a number of case studies are provided to illustrate the major benefits of the Pareto-based approach to machine learning, e.g., how to identify interpretable models and models that can generalize on unseen data from the obtained Pareto-optimal solutions. Three approaches to Pareto-based multiobjective ensemble generation are compared and discussed in detail. Finally, potentially interesting topics in multiobjective machine learning are suggested.","Yaochu Jin , Bernhard Sendhoff",415
9,"Silver nanoparticles: mechanism of antimicrobial action, synthesis, medical applications, and toxicity effects","Silver nanoparticles are nanoparticles of silver which are in the range of 1 and 100 nm in size. Silver nanoparticles have unique properties which help in molecular diagnostics, in therapies, as well as in devices that are used in several medical procedures. The major methods used for silver nanoparticle synthesis are the physical and chemical methods. The problem with the chemical and physical methods is that the synthesis is expensive and can also have toxic substances absorbed onto them. To overcome this, the biological method provides a feasible alternative. The major biological systems involved in this are bacteria, fungi, and plant extracts. The major applications of silver nanoparticles in the medical field include diagnostic applications and therapeutic applications. In most of the therapeutic applications, it is the antimicrobial property that is being majorly explored, though the anti-inflammatory property has its fair share of applications. Though silver nanoparticles are rampantly used in many medical procedures and devices as well as in various biological fields, they have their drawbacks due to nanotoxicity. This review provides a comprehensive view on the mechanism of action, production, applications in the medical field, and the health and environmental concerns that are allegedly caused due to these nanoparticles. The focus is on effective and efficient synthesis of silver nanoparticles while exploring their various prospective applications besides trying to understand the current scenario in the debates on the toxicity concerns these nanoparticles pose.",Sukumaran Prabhu & Eldho K Poulose,2106
10,User's contribution to radical innovation:evidence from four cases in the field of medical equipement technology,"This paper focuses on contributions of users in early phases of radical innovation projects. In a multiple case study analysis in the field of medical equipment technology, we identify characteristics of users who contribute substantially to the development of radical innovations by being their inventors and (co)-developers. These innovative users have high motivation to seek new solutions, possess a diverse set of competencies, and are embedded in a supportive environment. We furthermore observe that they play an entrepreneurial role as they establish and organize the required innovation networks. These innovation networks are needed to transform the users' radically new concepts into first physical prototypes and marketable products. The study highlights how manufacturing firms can benefit from innovative and entrepreneurial users in the early phases of radical innovation projects.","Christopher Lettl, Cornelius Herstatt,Hans Georg Gemuenden",670

12,Development and evaluation of a rapid CRISPR-based diagnostic for COVID-19,"The recent outbreak of human infections caused by SARS-CoV-2, the third zoonotic coronavirus has raised great public health concern globally. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of this novel pathogen posts great challenges not only clinically but also technologically. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) have been the most commonly used molecular methodologies. However, each has their own limitations. In this study, we developed an isothermal, CRISPR-based diagnostic for COVID-19 with near single-copy sensitivity. The diagnostic performances of all three technology platforms were also compared. Our study aimed to provide more insights into the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2, and also to present a novel diagnostic option for this new emerging virus.","Tieying Hou,Weiqi Zeng,Minling Yang, Wenjing Chan, Lili Ren,Jingwen Ai, Ji Wu, Yalong Liao ,Xuejing Gou , Yongjun Li, Xiaouri Wang,Hang Su",145

14,Low cycle fatigue study of lead free 99.3Sn–0.7Cu solder alloy,"In this paper, low cycle fatigue studies on 99.3Sn–0.7Cu lead free solder was evaluated over a range of test temperatures (298, 348 and 398 K) and frequencies (10−3–1 Hz), tested at four values of total strain range (2, 3.5, 5 and 7.5%). The fatigue performance of lead free 99.3Sn–0.7Cu solder was compared to 63Sn–37Pb solder. The effects of temperature and frequency on the low cycle fatigue life were discussed and were presented in Coffin–Manson and Morrow model relationships. Frequency modified Coffin–Manson and Morrow models were proposed for predicting the effect of frequency on low cycle fatigue life of 99.3Sn–0.7Cu solder alloy.","B.S.Xiong,T.H.Low",120
15,Blockchain challenges and opportunities: a survey,"Blockchain has numerous benefits such as decentralisation, persistency, anonymity and auditability. There is a wide spectrum of blockchain applications ranging from cryptocurrency, financial services, risk management, internet of things (IoT) to public and social services. Although a number of studies focus on using the blockchain technology in various application aspects, there is no comprehensive survey on the blockchain technology in both technological and application perspectives. To fill this gap, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the blockchain technology. In particular, this paper gives the blockchain taxonomy, introduces typical blockchain consensus algorithms, reviews blockchain applications and discusses technical challenges as well as recent advances in tackling the challenges. Moreover, this paper also points out the future directions in the blockchain technology.","Zibin Zheng, Shaoan Xie,Xianping Chen,Hong-Ning Dai,Huaimin Wang",2237
